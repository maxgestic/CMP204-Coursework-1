							<h3>Who is the Snake Charmer?</h3>

							<p class="p-font" id="about-p">	
								I am Archy Jay, and i primarily play a set of electronic bagpipes with a mean looking dragon head! I love to push the sterotype boundaries of bagpipes and blend it with modern music. Crossover music is my thing!<br>
								<br>
								I decided that I wanted to incorporate bagpipes in different types of music genres. But that is not as easy as it sounds.<br>
								<br>
								I soon found out that there is no proper bagpipe teacher in India. And also, the fact that bagpipes are one of the toughest instruments in the world to play.
								But my vision remained solid. I wanted to know how bagpipes would sound in a normal song and not just in parade bands.<br>
								<br>
								So I decided to soldier on and started learning on my own. I knew how to read music so I downloaded e-books from the Internet to learn how to play.<br>
								<br>
								I admit that I did have the occasional breakdown and there were several instances when I considered quitting. But I didn't, and i am so glad about that!<br>
								Such was my determination that I started e-mailing veteran bagpipers to help me out. This went in vain for a while until one man from the US, Sean Folson, replied. He eventually became my guide.<br>
								<br>
								Just like anything else that's new, I had to start at the bottom. I began learning on a 'practice chanter'. A practice chanter is an instrument used to learn how to play the bagpipes.<br>
								<br>
								Once that was done, there was another challenge in front of me. I had to choose the correct bagpipe for myself and that is when I found out that there are more than 100 varieties of bagpipes available.<br>
								<br>
								Stuff like temperature also has to be taken into account before buying a bagpipe.<br>
								<br>
								After months of thinking, I picked one and went to Scotland for a 5-day tuition in Glasgow to brush up my skills.<br>
								<br>
								Once I was back, I wanted to see to what extent a bagpipe could be utilised and also how far and wide it could go in different music forms & genres.<br>
								<br>
								The inspiration behind my stage name stems from the fact that I does not want to forget my Indian roots. Foreigners often assume that India is a land full of snake charmers so I wanted to show them that if that's how we're going to be typecast, this is how well we can do the charming .<br>
								<br>
								And thus, with a wind instrument in my arm, 'The Snake Charmer' was born.
